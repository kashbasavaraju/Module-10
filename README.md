## Challenge: Crypto Clustering

Objective: Using Python and concepts of unsupervised learning, we will cluster different cryptocurrencies by performance.

Crypto data was imported and then made into a dataframe.

Using scaled data, the optimal K value was found in order to find the efficient number of clusters to use for our model.

Sklearn was applied to graph results

Using PCA, only the relevant components of the data were filtered for - using sklearn, we find that the filtered data elimitates outliers and allows for less variance in the data sets to provide meaningful data.

The results are as shown:
